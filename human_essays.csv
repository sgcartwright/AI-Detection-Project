The Mona Lisa,art,1,"The Mona Lisa picture above is written with the use of paint and pigments using the brush and sponges and it is an original copy of the world’s greatest work. Mehra and Campbell (2018) stated that Leonardo da Vinci did the picture in the period between 1503 and 1506 in Italy. Originally, Italy was the world’s center of art, literature, theatre, and many other countries tried to adjust their culture based on Italian techniques. The picture of the Mona Lisa constantly inspires thousands of people, and those who want to receive more energy to develop their professional skills can go to the Louvre museum in France. Nowadays, individuals have a chance to see the original copy of the masterpiece, and this fact fascinates many art fans. The author of the picture has presented the happiness contexts, but some professionals may argue. Serious analyses might help me expand my knowledge and become more experienced in the art sphere. Reading, analyzing, and understanding the world’s greatest works is crucial for those who want to connect future life and career with the sphere. Art and literature have a long history that requires professionals a lot of time spent reading books and articles. Nevertheless, when people are interested in this topic, the work becomes more interesting and existing. Works of such artists have always inspired me as Picasso, Dali, and Michelangelo, and I could spend all my free time reading their biography and how they decided to write pictures."
Starry Night,art,1,"The masterpiece depicts the view from the window in his asylum room with the addition of an imaginary village. Since 1941, the piece of art has been owned by the Modern Museum of Art in New York City. This picture is a perfect representation of Van Gogh’s distinctive style and creates a strange but breathtaking impression. The artwork provides an uneasy feeling as if it has been painted with the mental struggle of the author. The first element of the composition that captures attention is the great blurry sky that takes one-third of the canvas. The sky emphasizes a bright crescent moon in the top right corner, which creates a powerful balance and, at the same time, contrast with the giant black fire on the opposite side. Another contrast may be seen in the color dynamics of the whirling sky that provide the sense of surreal harmony compared to the dull mixed colors of the imaginary village. The artwork seems to be filled with uneasy emotions and even paranoia of the author. The emphasis on the big bright sky may represent Van Gogh’s desire to fly away from his reality and embrace the light of the starry night. However, the enormous dark fire, which plays the role of some dark force in his painting, rises almost to the top of the picture. It may be described as if the dark creation of reality tries to cover the beloved stars from the author and steal his attention. In this light, the masterpiece tells the story about Van Gogh’s most precious object, starry sky."
The Last Supper,art,1,"The Last Supper is one the most renowned work of art in the human history. A celebrated Italian painter named Leonardo da Vinci did the painting between the years 1494 and 1499 (Barcilon & Marani, 2001). Many writers have described da Vinci as an intelligent academic painter with an outstanding impression (Kemp, 2011). The painting was specially made as part of a project to refurbish a cathedral by Ludovico Sforza who was the duke of Milan.During the time of the painting, da Vinci was working for Sforza. Having worked for him for eighteen years, Sforza saw it right for his servant to paint a portrait of a religious scene (Zani, 2001). The original painting of the art is situated in the Santa Maria delle Grazie Church in Milan. This piece of art is painted onto the rear part of the church’s banquet hall. The painting measures 5 by 29 feet. This art was painted using a tempera style. As such, the style combines the use of egg yolks, vinegar, and oil paints. The combinations of these materials were applied onto dried plaster.The work depicted the scene of the last supper as illustrated in the Bible. Through the painting, da Vinci was able to show how Jesus’ disciples reacted to his announcement that one of them was going to hand him over to the authorities. Based on the painting, da Vinci illustrates that Jesus’ disciples were shocked by the news.The painting shows 13 men sitting at the back of a table. The person in the center of the picture is Jesus Christ. "
The Sistine Chapel,art,1,"When thinking about the renaissance, one thinks about the Sistine Chapel ceiling immediately. There is no other way around. The canonic Creation of Adam seems to have become the representation of the era. Though, being inspired by the Biblical narrations and monitored by the church closely, the imagery of the Sistine Chapel ceiling was not only charged with strong Christian morals and values, but also concealed the ideas, in which Michelangelo dared venture into several ambiguous areas and point at some of the most obvious issues in Christianity. In a retrospect, it is very weird to realize that what was supposed to be the symbol of Christianity and, therefore, the corresponding values, such as humbleness, humility and peacefulness was, in fact, inspired by the attempt of Pope Julius III to enhance the papal power and strengthen the influence of the Church on the civilians. Nevertheless, the fact that one of the most majestic creations of the Renaissance was built for rather dubious reasons and after quite cold calculations is true. However, one must give credit to Julius III for allowing for some sentiment when naming the chapel after his uncle, Pope Sixtus IV (Adams 336). Michelangelo was supposed to carry out massive work, and the creation of the ceiling took quite a while. Being a sculptor and not a painter, Michelangelo was facing a real challenge."
The Persistence of Memory,art,1,"Some of the most remarkable parts of the study unit are connected with surrealism and cubism, specifically with Salvador Dali and his artworks. Making familiar and straightforward objects look unusual and gaining a broader sense than it seems is an exceptional field to study that eventually leads to understanding art. Berger has managed to develop several thoughts on the way of seeing objects and paintings in particular. Therefore, this paper aims to analyze one of the most famous paintings by Salvador Dali, “The Persistence of Memory,” its meaning, message, and possible interpretation of the depicted objects. While observing the piece of art, Berger’s ideas and outlooks on the painting and objects will be considered and aligned with the analysis. Surrealism captured public attention at the beginning of the 20th century, and there are specific reasons for this. Artists of that time, such as Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso, who were the massive inspiration for the first one, showed a unique way of depicting common objects. They have created an imaginary unrealistic world from the plain and ordinary scenes that stimulate the audience’s imagination and perception of everyday life (Martinez-Conde et al. 8). The picture illustrates the landscape, plain, empty with no trees or grass, only the soil surrounding the sea and the melted clocks are placed on the ground and the stick. The fly sits on one of the clocks, and on the other, ants gather together. "
Nighthawks,art,1,"Edward Hopper’s Nighthawks was drawn in 1942 and catches the oddity of dejection in metropolitan life. It is an existential emergency where a gathering of people fall prey to the disengaging quietness of New York City. Hopper’s comprehension of the expressive prospects of light playing on worked on shapes gives the composition its magnificence. Specialty of the 1940s starts with pictures of war and the American Depression. The work is the reaction to the besieging of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, and the passage of the United States into World War II (Lasch & Dionne, 2018). The setting subsequently transmits around a city in a real sense and metaphorically obscured by emergency. Sharp glaring lights drain onto the obscured roads of New York City, while four strangers lounge around the counter of a late-night burger joint. Individuals on the work of art are truly close yet mentally miles separated. The artist’s famous painting uncovers individuals’ failure to interface in the mid 1940s (Lasch & Dionne, 2018). Nighthawks portrays not just the harsh distance of living in an enormous city, yet the neurosis that held the United States after the 1941 Pearl Harbor assault (Dossin, 2017). Tensions longer than a subsequent assault covered the city like the continuous power outage penetrates New York and its inhabitants were exposed to.There is no way to enter the coffee shop, the occasion is happening outside. "
Bird in Space,art,1,"Constantin Brancusi’s Bird in Space is one of the Norton Simon’s most iconic 20th-century sculptures. It commands the most prominent spot in the Modern Art gallery, its gleaming yellow-bronze surface magnificent under the skylighted rotunda. Its placement there is the culmination of a long process of art historical inquiry, scientific investigation and conservation treatment since its acquisition in 1972, requiring some challenging issues to be resolved. After riding out the Northridge earthquake in 1994 on a low, heavy concrete pedestal, the artwork was loaned to two important exhibitions. Upon its return, we were determined to install it safely enough to survive a major earthquake, and in a manner that was most appropriate to the artist’s original intention. Although the Bird retained its highly reflective polish, it had blemishes and discolored areas. Conservation treatment and development of the best approach to maintaining the lustrous surface directed by the artist would require careful study. Brancusi had very specific notions about how his various Bird in Space sculptures were to be experienced—their height, their relationship to a base and pedestal made by the artist and their surface qualities, whether marble or bronze. Part of what makes the Norton Simon’s sculpture so successful in seeming to defy gravity also makes it potentially vulnerable to damage in an earthquake. Precariously standing on a slender foot, constricting and then swelling upward."
The Treachery of Images,art,1,"I started analyzing paintings, when, for the very first time, I heard the common saying “a picture speaks a thousand words.” When I realized this reality, art became a mystery to me – a mystery I was set on solving. Each painting has hidden meaning, whether the artist intended this or not. ""The Treachery of Images,"" a painting by French Surrealist Painter Rene Magritte is a prime example of this. What separates this specific image and its message from others is its use of language. So, what is ""The Treachery of Images"" trying to say?To the untrained eye, this legendary painting could easily be dismissed at first sight. The first reaction being that it is an illustration of a pipe, and below the pipe are the words ""Ceci n’est pas un pipe.” This is not a pipe. We look at this image, but to really understand it, we need to first understand ourselves. Human beings have assumed for centuries that language and reality have an organic relationship, that the names of things came about us viewing. That an apple is an apple, and a tree is a tree when, in all actuality, we don’t really know things, but just access their image through language. We are confident that what we say and what we see correspond. In reality, this is completly untrue, and when we are reminded of this simple fact, it strips us of our certainty. This is especially true for Magritte's work."
The Raft of the Medusa,art,1,"At a glance, the painting depicts people swimming on the raft. Their faces are exhausted, and it seems that they have been swimming for weeks or even months. The raft is almost broken, but still it is controlled by people. Some of the people are desperately trying to find the way home whereas others lost their hope in front of death. While looking at the painting once again, I have noticed that the raft is surrounded by high waves that could break the raft any moment because almost all wood boards are damaged, and it is clear that victims of the storm will never return home. The figures presented in the background look more confident and ambitious; they are looking for the earth. People in the foreground look extremely tired and hopeless. It also seems that the sailors were the members of the crew, but their ship was eventually wrecked. Those who managed to survive built a raft and decided to move forward until they reached the coast. Although there is a hope for survival, the dark wave to the left of the raft seems to smash the raft. So, when I looked at this wave, I was a bit shocked because the painting represents the moment before all people will die. Apart from the plot, figures, and background, I also noticed the tones and colors that the artist used to deliver the message. Most of the colors are warm and pale; even the sea is not of usual color. The pallet of the painting is predominated by brown, yellow, red, and grey colors."
The Night Watch,art,1,"In 1642, Rembrandt van Rijn was commissioned by the mayor and civic guard leader of Amsterdam, Banning Cocq, to create a group portrait of his shooting company. The resulting painting is now recognised as one of the most important artworks ever created and currently hangs in a custom built room in the Rijksmuseum. Although there are 34 characters present on the canvas, only 16 were real-life members of militia and each of these men paid 100 Dutch guilders for their portrait. The two most senior officers, Captain Banning Cocq and his lieutenant Willem van Ruytenburch, stand at the front of the picture wearing a red sash and yellow hat respectively. Rembrandt painted the rest of the company as though they were preparing for patrol with several members inspecting their muskets and gesturing beyond the frame. Rembrandt added several details to the painting in order to introduce symbols associated with the company and musketeers in general. The woman standing behind Banning Cocq, for example, is carrying the militia’s goblet while in the background an ensign waves the group’s flag.At the time, it was quite common for civic guards or other military troops to commission group portraits that usually hung in their headquarters and many other Dutch masters such as Frans Hals created similar paintings. Rembrandt’s painting though is among the largest of its kind and the subjects depicted on this massive canvas are almost life size."
Ode to Joy,music,1,"“Day by day I am approaching the goal which I apprehend but cannot describe,” Ludwig van Beethoven (December 16, 1770–March 26, 1827) wrote to his boyhood friend, rallying his own resilience as he began losing his hearing. A year later, shortly after completing his Second Symphony, he sent his brothers a stunning letter about the joy of suffering overcome, in which he resolved: Ah! how could I possibly quit the world before bringing forth all that I felt it was my vocation to produce? That year, he began — though he did not yet know it, as we never do — the long gestation of what would become not only his greatest creative and spiritual triumph, not only a turning point in the history of music that revolutionized the symphony and planted the seed of the pop song, but an eternal masterwork of the supreme human art: making meaning out of chaos, beauty out of sorrow. Across the epochs, “Ode to Joy” rises vast and eternal, transcending all of spacetime and at the same time compacting it into something so intimate, so immediate, that nothing seems to exist outside this singularity of all-pervading possibility. Inside its total drama, a total tranquility; inside its revolt, an oasis of refuge. The story of its making is as vitalizing as the masterpiece itself — or, rather, its story is the very reason for its vitality. As a teenager, while auditing Kant’s lectures at the University of Bonn, Beethoven had fallen under the spell of transcendental idealism."
Beethoven's Fifth,music,1,"Beethoven’s 5th symphony is one of the most recognized symphonies in the world. Being written for a particular set of instruments, this melody has been performed by different orchestras and with the involvement of some additional set of instruments. Beethoven’s 5th symphony has numerous variations as being performed by a particular person, he/she may have a desire to insert some changes in the sound and motif. Having conducted research, I came across a classical performance of Beethoven’s 5th symphony and the same symphony performed by the London Classical Players conducted by Roger Norrington. The same composition, the same piece of music is performed differently. It is hard to say that the music is absolutely different, however, having listened to these two performances it becomes obvious that slice aspects are varied. Analyzing just the first movement of Beethoven’s 5th symphony, the similarity and differences are going to be discussed for a better understanding this piece of music. The classical first movement of Beethoven’s 5th symphony is written for the following set of instruments, flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, horns, trumpets, timpani and strings. The symphony begins with a famous distinctive four-note motif which is repeated twice. This four-note motif has the following structure, short-short-short-long. These four notes have become a real point for discussion as different authors could not come to the conclusion how this specific part should be played."
Suite Bergamasque,music,1,"Suite Bergamasque is one of the best-loved piano compositions by Claude Debussy. It is performed often in recitals and continues to gain popularity in the classical and popular realms. The focus of this research paper is to present the compositional history of Claude Debussy’s Suite Bergamasque, to analyze all four movements, with special attention to the music of “Clair de Lune,” and to explore the works of art and poetry that inspired it, as well as some of the connections between the music, poetry, and art that influenced Debussy overall. This paper first explores the complicated compositional history of the suite. Suite Bergamasque was first written in 1890, but completed and published in 1905. This study of the historical background will give us an increased understanding of Debussy’s compositional development as demonstrated in this work. Then, I will analyze all movements of Suite Bergamasque, considering harmonic language, formal structure, and performance practice. I will next focus on analyzing the relationship between “Clair de Lune” and the other movements, compositionally and in relation to the words and paintings that inspired the work. Finally, I will demonstrate the connections between Debussy’s music and the poetry of Paul Verlaine, as well as the works of the French painter Jean-Antoine Watteau."
Clair de Lune,music,1,"he title of the song means moonlight, which mirrors the feel of the song and its musicality. The song has a soft, soothing rhythm that creates a dreamlike peaceful feeling as one listens. The rhythm is catchy and demands an audience. It captures the attention of the listener to the end, banking on its mysterious tonal variation, such that the listener does not know what to expect as the song progresses. It has a pleasant celestial melody that resonates with silence and peace. It uses tonal variation using instruments to create an almost celestial sweet melody. The melody and the rhythm work to design the harmony of the song (Scruton, 2011). The song triggers a nostalgic, dreamy vibe. It makes one think about all the peaceful memories one has had. It makes one remain grounded and glued to the music, not responding to any distractions. The song creates a sad, melancholic mood, which makes the listener to remember the sad, soulful things of the past. Also, it gives one a sense of light rain at night while people play instruments silently. The song “Clair de Lune” is Apollonian. It is about thinking and stillness. Dionysian music associates with dancing and movement and is generally ecstatic (Leeming, 2016). The song discussed herein has nothing to do with that. It is soft, pleasant and harmonious and inspires thoughts and feelings. Its musicality does not resonate with dance and such movement. It is more collected and grounding."
Bohemian Rhapsody,music,1,"The song is notable as it does not convey a clearly outlined message but allows the listeners to find the meaning themselves and reflect on the artist’s life. I viewed the video of the live performance on February 10 at a local movie theatre. The concert was screened in relation to the British Academy of Film and Theatre Award (BAFTA), where the movie Bohemian Rhapsody was nominated for several awards (“The Full List of Winners”). By completing this analysis, I want to stress the significance of Mercury’s and Queen’s works and explain the meaning of one of the most famous of them. Bohemian Rhapsody is a song that has caused many questions and assumptions because its author did not provide much information about it. Mercury could have created Bohemian Rhapsody for various reasons. One of the possible ones is that the singer wanted to produce a piece of music that would make a revolution in its time. The song is outstanding as it combines classical and rock music; its lyrics can be interpreted differently. Mercury could have wanted to gain public interest in Queens and propel its works to the next level. Queen’s music was not particularly influenced by historical conditions but was linked to societal ones. Mercury’s works reflected the changes in his socio-economic status when he moved to Great Britain from Zanzibar. The artist changed his name to establish a sense of belonging with the society and match with his inner self. "
Fur Elise,music,1,"Ludwig van Beethoven’s Bagatelle No. 25, known as Fur Elise, has a charming quality that demonstrates why it has been popular since its publication. Beethoven’s only instruction to performers is the phrase “molto grazioso” which means “very gracefully.” This gives pianists plenty of leeway as to dynamics, phrasing, and other forms of interpretive musicianship. Für Elise is in 3/4 time and has a structure that allows the listener to become familiar with the melody through several repetitions. The name for this structure is the rondo, represented by letters for the different themes, such as A for Theme 1, B for Theme 2, and so forth. Für Elise has the structure of ABACA. The piece begins with the first part of the melodic statement, which is repeated and then leads to a second part of this statement that ends with octaves on the dominant, almost in the form of a question. The familiar melody recurs, the second part is repeated, and once again the melody answers the second statement. This entire section comprises Theme 1. At this point Theme 2 is introduced in a new key, and the difficulty level increases. Beethoven has the new theme end on the relative major, repeats it, and then adds a surprise by making it end on the seventh of the original key, thereby neatly returning the listener to the familiar beginning of Theme 1. After this “A” section is heard, Theme 3 appears with driving sixteenth notes in the left hand for sixteen measures. "
In the Hall of the Mountain King,music,1,"“In the Hall of the Mountain King” (Norwegian: “I Dovregubbens hall”), composed by Edvard Grieg, is a piece of orchestral music, Opus 23, originally for Henrik Ibsen’s famous play, Peer Gynt. Even though it was later separated as the final piece of Peer Gynt, Suite Suite No. 1, Op. 46, the play was first performed on February 24, 1876 in Oslo. The most recognisable element of this two and a half minute composition is that it starts very slowly and softly, then becomes faster and louder until it is very fast and loud; resembling a chase. Edvard Hagerup Grieg (1843-1907), was a famous Norwegian nationalist composer of the Romantic era, born in Bergen on June 15, 1843. His family had a history of musicians, including his Scottish grandfather and Norwegian mother who studied music at Hamburg. Edvard started to take piano lessons from his mother at the age of six, which later led him into attending the Leipzig Music Conservatory in 1858 after being advised to do so by famous violinist Ole Bull. Between 1858 and 1863, he was influenced by styles of Mendelssohn and Schumann, suffered a serious attack of pleurisy, causing permanent damage to one of his lungs, and visited Copenhagen. Slowly, the repeated melody is played at a higher pitch with additional instruments including, violins and violas partnered with oboes and clarinets, showing trolls beginning to quietly follow Peer. The chase becomes faster and louder, as shown by the increasing speed and volume of the music."
Ride of the Valkyries,music,1,"Richard Wagner was a German composer, theatre director, and conductor who is primarily known for his operas. His music can be heard in many movies and some are very popular. Among his popular music, you can include “Ride of the Valkyries” that is featured in the film “What’s Opera Doc?” Many of Wagner’s pieces of music tended to be more on the dramatic side, which influenced me to choose this classical music as one of my favorites. “Ride of the Valkyries” is a very powerful piece. The strong brass and bass reminds me of going into a battle head on. In fact, I have downloaded this song from iTunes to listen to right before my swim meets. It pumps me up and gets me ready for the races and battles to come. Without the masculine features of this song, it would not be the same. This piece of music has somewhat of a comical side, as seen in some cartoons that it was used in, including Bugs Bunny. This just adds to the overall piece, giving it a little entertaining feature. It gives it more character and speaks rich harmonies and complex textures. This made me like the track more and helped it become one of my favorite pieces of classical music. There are elements in Wagner’s music that cannot be found anywhere else. Wagner’s music is still widely performed. More than a century after his death, his legacy is still debated, his influence still felt in our very conception of Western music. In the contemporary forms of opera and the complete spectrum of theater and literary arts."
Requiem,music,1,"Of all verbal arts, poetry might be the most saturated with metaphors and other means of communicating emotional subtext. Anna Akhmatova’s “Requiem”, a long poem mourning the victims of the Soviet repressions is not an exception. To express the feelings of loss, the poetess uses metaphors, comparisons, and other tools of verbal expression. This essay seeks to provide examples of such uses of language by Akhmatova and explain their effect on the reader’s experience. “Requiem” was written when many Soviet people lost their loved ones, and grief was the primary emotion of the populace. The poem is comprised of smaller poems written by Akhmatova in the years 1935 and through 1940, during and following the period of Russian history known as “The Great Purge” or “Yezhovschina” (Akhmatova, “Instead of a Preface”). It lasted for two years, from 1936 to 1937, and is known for the large-scale campaign of political repression by the USSR officials (History.com Editors, 2018, para. 1). In “Requiem”, Akhmatova captured the universal feeling of grief, mourning, and fruitless desperation which reigned over the Soviet people, Anna included. The main aspect of the poem’s critiques is its disputed alignment with the genre stated in the title due to the main aspect of the poem being arrest and not death. However, Emilia Smith (2019) argues that an elegy is “occasioned by death, but more accurately it can be defined as a poem about loss” (para. 3). "
Moonlight Sonata,music,1,"Where does one begin, when describing the legendary sound of the first movement of Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata, Piano Sonata No. 14, or Sonata quasi una fantasia? Surely one of the most recognizable pieces of Classical music, it’s transcended generations, ages and critics to remain one of the foremost beautiful, universally recognized pieces of music. From the mighty blow of the first chord of the first movement, the journey begins on a troubling, nerve-wracking note, building and twisting. At times it tricks me as though it’s letting go, but it’s an illusion. The winding arpeggios suck me in, the supporting chords hammering away at my brain through the air, filling every nerve ending, overpowering the senses. Many cry listening to the Moonlight Sonata, I can only imagine because of the depth to which it pierces the soul with builds which peak, leaving me thirsting for more, but then bring me back down to earth. I listen to this piece quite often when in a somber mood, it just happens naturally. Grey skies, the rain, wind blowing across a field at night, a chilly beach without swimmers, a lonely leaf spinning to the ground as it streaks across the autumn sky. For me, the Moonlight Sonata is a sobering reminder of the ups and downs of life, and that everything is finite, with a beginning and an end. At times, within the six or so minute period from beginning to end, it can become difficult or easy to breathe, the chest feels heavy then light."
World War 2,history,1,"The World War 2 began in 1939. This is when France and Britain declared war on Germany. This occurred when Germany invaded Poland and therefore, this is what triggered the outbreak of war. However, the causes of the war are more complex. The major causes of this Great War were the unresolved issues that resulted from the World War 1. Another reason was due to the effects of the Great Depression. This occurred in the 1930s. Another reason is the interwar period in Europe. Several events accumulated and led to the outbreak of the war. One of the events that contributed to the series of events includes the invasion that occurred in Poland in 1939. Soviet Russia and Germany were responsible for this invasion. Another event that had a great effect was the invasion into Republic of China. The Empire of Japan was responsible for this and this occurred in 1937. Several European powers such as the United Kingdom, Russia and France expanded their territories using force and aggression. This is a process that was referred to as expansionism or imperialism. Germany and Italy were not as successful as the other nations when it came to gaining territory under colonial rule. When Germany lost land to the other nations, it led to their relocation. This caused Germans to get bitter and this interfered with their relations with their neighbors. This contributed to the feeling of revanchism. Germany started a program that would lead to the restoration of the country’s rightful boundaries."
Emancipation of slavery,history,1,"The history of slavery has had a huge impact on both the United States and African Americans in its territory. Gradually, American Society made the transition from the general public approval of slavery to the movement of abolitionism. The North and South of the US also differed significantly in their perception of this practice. While pro-slavery arguments were actively developed and persisted for a long time in the South, the concept of free labor and the first attempts at abolitionism was born in the North. Southerners viewed slavery as morally justified by appealing to the intellectual inferiority of African Americans and the happiness that their masters brought them. Northerners, on the contrary, believed that slavery violated the human rights of African Americans, which did not allow moral justification for this practice. Non-expansionist arguments marked the transitional period between full acceptance and the abolition of slavery, trying to describe the necessary transformations. Pro-slavery, non-expansionist, and abolitionist perspectives on the moral foundations of slavery identify both differences between the North and south of the US and the gradual evolution of the nation’s view of African people. The pro-slavery view was prevalent in the US South, where the vast plantations needed extensive slave labor. This perspective was partly based on the belief that there were fundamental differences between races. "
The Roman Empire,history,1,"The decline of the Roman Empire in the West that began in the 5th century had multiple interconnected factors. In general, Rome has faced multiple internal and external problems that led to the split of an amazingly coherent and stable state into smaller political segments. First of all, the Roman Empire was impacted by its overexpansion – the government of its vast territories was accompanied by multiple logistical and administrative issues. A lack of quick and efficient communication between the parts of the Empire led to corruption and political instability that weakened the country. As a result, the Roman Empire could not sustain the invasions of barbarian tribes that, in turn, became more well-organized and powerful due to the prolonged periods of trade and cooperation with the country’s borders. Due to tribes’ attacks, Rome started to lose its western territories (Brooks, 2019). This situation caused the shrinkage of tax revenues, incorrect distribution of taxes, and military overspending. While the east was supported in defending Roman sovereignty, western Roman armies were vulnerable and underfunded. Both external and internal challenges of the Roman Empire created a vicious circle of lost revenue, poor military performance, and lost land (Brooks, 2019). With already lost unity and coherence, the Roman legions were unable to protect their land from invaders. The development of the Eastern Empire contributed to the decline of the Western Empire as well. "
The Civil Rights Movement,history,1,"The “I Have a Dream” speech by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. is a powerful message that remains relevant to both the United States and the world even today. The speech is full of outrage, contains allusions to the Bible and the US Declaration of Independence. It is considered one of the best in the history of mankind. The main theses of King’s political speeches were not only the equalization of the rights of Whites and Blacks, but also a more global idea – world peace for the sake of the prosperity of humanity. According to Corbett et al. (2017), King’s speech became the peak of the Civil Rights Movement, legitimizing its goals. The March was organized by Philip Randolph and Bayard Ruston to advocate for the civil and economic rights of the blacks in the United States. In the United States, the 1960s was characterized by the rise of Civil Rights Movements, the aim of which was to suppress and end discrimination and racial segregation against African Americans. It was during the 1960s that the African Americans began realizing accomplishments in their struggle for civil rights, and using them as a base for fighting further. Galvin (2020) states that “the basic narrative of justice is of a brutally oppressed people who took the initiative, defined their own needs, and demanded freedom” (p. 1). The most used strategies by the Civil Rights Movement included freedom rides, boycotts, voter registration drives, marches, and sit-ins."
The signing of the Declaration of Independence,history,1,"The Declaration of Independence articulates the ideals upon which America came into existence, including why it separated from Great Britain. Every American had a key duty of joining the war for independence, with Thomas Jefferson not being an exception. The historic politician played a key role in promoting equality in the United States and the world. Although Thomas Jefferson displayed hypocrisy, his work proved to be critical for the founding of America. The phrase “Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed” was an insight that every American had equal rights and powers to oversee the political practices (Barnett, 2019, p. 24). The political freedom aimed at ensuring they realize their independence from the English that invaded their country. Thus, your arguments are applicable in overseeing the understanding of American history. The main aim of political groups is to bring together people with similar views on the government. These groups are working on indulging in the government and affecting it through its members’ elected government. Different people have distinct ideologies on the strategies to run a country. Nonetheless, the political contest between John Adam and Thomas Jefferson exhibited democracy. Although their conflicting ideologies exposed the Americans to divisive politics, all the political players endeavored to guarantee a sustainable America in future. """
The Black Plague,history,1,"Diseases that cause a massive devastation in a given geographical region pose a major threat. Being contagious can spread easily and their prevention becomes herculean task for health care professionals. The present paper is concerned with highlighting a disease known as plague that caused epidemic in the 13th century in United States. Plague, also known Bubonic plague, is an infectious disease that results from the causative agent Yersinia pestis. Infected rats play role in spreading he disease to humans and it is visually characterized by increased lymph nodes in the regions of neck, groin, armpits and other regions (Plague Glossary, 2012). Plague has derived it’s another name “Black death”. In epic percentages, it has caused death of people and is considered as medieval pandemic in history. In detail, between the years 1348 and 1350 Black Death occurred. European population of nearly 30 to 60% has fallen victims to Black Death which indicates the death of 450 million in the year 1400 (Baxamusa,2011). The disease was first believed to occur in China in the year 1328 when an outbreak had occurred. This made the reduction of Chinese population from 125 million to 90 million in short period of 50 years. The disease next made its way to Bristol, and then to London, England. The reasons for rapid spreading of disease were suspected to be poor living conditions associated with Overpopulation. In London city, from the overall population of 70,000, nearly 20,000 people died. "
The bombing of Hiroshima,history,1,"The debate about the feasibility of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is controversial to this day. Bombing advocates tend to explain their position by arguing that the use of atomic weapons prevented the continuation of World War II and direct incursions, in which, according to statistics, many more people would die (Selden & Selden, 2015). In addition, the refusal of Japanese troops to surrender and Japan’s “all-out war” have also been put forward as arguments in favor of the bombing that stopped the atrocities of the “all-out war” of Japanese soldiers in China and ended the war in general. However, in my opinion, the use of such weapons, even in such conditions, does not justify the United States for several reasons. First, the use of atomic weapons fundamentally carries with it at the moment the highest degree of barbarism and the grave consequences of its use. The cost of human lives determines the immorality of this weapon and the severe illnesses of the survivors, the high level of radiation at the site of the bombings, and, accordingly, the inability to use this territory for life or anything else. Second, the military necessity of using atomic weapons has not been proven. There is a point of view that Japan’s surrender would be inevitable very shortly. No wonder further agreements of many countries prohibited nuclear weapons since this is a hazardous type of weapon. Many famous personalities interpreted these bombings as crimes against humanity."
The French Revolution,history,1,"When the French people revolted against the monarchy in 1789, Louis XVI was King of France. Marie Antoinette was his young and beautiful queen. Many events during the revolution have been attributed to her. She is thought to have contributed to the people’s disdain for the monarchy. The queen’s love for expensive adornments and involvement in various scandals elicited resentment in the French. Excessive taxes and rising food prices increased the loathing they had for Marie Antoinette. She was a victim of the revolution, more than she was a villain. When Louis XVI became king, he inherited, from his grandfather, a country that was in shambles. He had to grapple with escalating prices of basic necessities like bread, growing resentment for the social strata (by the peasantry and common people), high taxes and growing unpopularity in the international community. These are just among a horde of other problems facing France at the time. France was heavily in debt owing to its participation in foreign crusades. At that time, taxes had to be increased in order to raise funds to pay off this debt. With the ascent to power of a young king, the French expected grand reforms to take place in France. They expected fresh and new ideas that would turn France and their lives around. This, however, was not to be. The young king did not implement the expected reforms, and persistently made bad economic decisions that worsened the situation."
9 11,history,1,"History relates not only to past events but to their discovery, collection, presentation, organization, and interpretation as well. The history of mankind goes along with the histories of people’s lives, global events go along with insignificant ones, and every historical event interpreted by people may be associated both with happiness and grief. My personal example is September 11, 2001, which may be defined as one of the most tragic days in American history when coordinated terrorist attacks have led to the death of thousands of innocent citizens. For the majority of people all over the world, this event is interpreted as a great disaster. However, for me, this day is associated with both pleasant and highly negative emotions. First of all, I was just recently married and was full of joy and happiness due to this event in my life. At the same time, September 11, 2001, is also a tragic day for me as for thousands of Americans as I have lost my friend who had visited the World Trade Center at the time of the attacks. History cannot be regarded in one common way as all events are interpreted by people individually on the basis of their knowledge, experience, and personal characteristics. At the same time, as a collection of events, history frequently depends on people’s social structures, culture, and beliefs. Thus, people may be left out of the historical narrative despite their contributions if their gender, race, age, or socioeconomic status are considered inferior."
The Magna Carta,history,1,"The Magna Carta has become known as the first successful attempt on limiting the powers of a ruling authority by citizens under the authority. The document, signed by King John of England in the presence of witnesses, gave more freedom for the people of England in later years. The documents in the Magna Carta set course for development of human rights and empowered parliament in the making of decisions. In the US, the founding fathers used the Magna Carta as a reference point when formulating the American constitution. This article entails a brief history on the source of the Magna Carta and details on its influence in American Law. The Magna Carta was first drafted by Stephen Langton, an Archbishop who was perceived as one of the most influential Barons in England. The document was previously known as the “articles of the Barons’, as it was drawn to reflect the discontent of Barons in light of King John’s rule (Clanchy 141). The document has also been referred to as the Great Charter or Magna Charter. The charter aimed to award more freedom to the non-serf community in the country, and thereby reduce the arbitrary powers of the king. It could be viewed as the first step to establish a constitution within a country. King John was reluctant to sign the charter into law since his powers would be reduced. The charter also set a foundation for the establishment of parliament. Several events led to the signing of the Magna Carta. "
George Washington,person,1,"Becoming president plays an essential role in the life of any politician, and when leaving office, everyone wants to leave the last word. “Farewell Address” is George Washington’s farewell speech when he decided not to run for the head of the country for the third time. The significant aspect of the president’s speech was the value of unity, loyalty to party over the nation, and the danger of foreign entanglements. These items he considered to be of utmost importance as he left office. The study of the main aspects of this letter plays a vital role in shaping how the policy of the United States of America developed after Washington left office. Therefore, the main point that stands out in George Washington’s speech is the emphasis on the value and importance of the community of the American people. This aspect also implied the primacy of the interests of the nation over differences, such as regional interests (Pruitt, 2020). In his speech, the outgoing president highlighted that “the independence and liberty you possess are the work of joint counselors, and joint efforts, of common dangers, sufferings, and successes” (“Washington’s Farewell Address 1796,” n.d., para.8). Thus, the politician noted that in order to achieve success and desired policy results, it is essential to strengthen community and relationships. The other main point, according to investigators, is to determine loyalty to the party over the nation is wrong and the government’s worst enemy. "
Rihanna,person,1,"Diamonds by Rihanna was first heard on Elvis Duran Show on September 26, 2012, availed for online download an hour after being released to the public, and was released as the album’s lead single the following day. Sia wrote the song for Rihanna, who holds the song’s copyrights and worked on it a year prior; therefore, the song is owned by an independent contractor (Anggraini 12). Unapologetic is Barbadian artist Rihanna’s seventh studio album, and the song “Diamonds” appears on it (Anggraini 7). Using Sia’s demo vocals as a guide, Rihanna imitated her inflections to the precise tiniest detail. It was only after Benny Blanco heard the finished track to the Australian songwriter did, she realize the vocals belonged to her alone. In Diamonds, Rihanna contemplated the existence of both love and diamonds: “Yellow diamonds in the light. To make things even more awkward, we’re standing next to each other. You cross my path as your shadow does.” The diamonds in the song symbolize a silver lining that illustrates the chance for a better future and happier days among dark and depressing days. The song made me think about all the possibilities available when things do not turn out to be as I expected. I also chose the song because its presentation, which was both positive and hopeful, and I am always in a good mood when I listen to it. It is also quite inspirational because it encourages listeners to love themselves."
Lionel Messi,person,1,"Soccer is one of the most popular sports on the planet, with hundreds of millions of watchers worldwide. The title for the best player in the world is currently contested between two remarkable and highly-talented players – Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. Although the impact of a single player is hard to determine in a game of two teams of 11 players each, it is possible to compare their playstyles, dynamics, and results. The purpose of this paper is to provide an accurate comparison between Ronaldo and Messi and determine the best player out of the two. Ronaldo is classified as a fast striker who uses his superior athletics and agility to get in position and deliver accurate goals, using his head and both feet. Ambidexterity, in that regard, makes it easier for him to strike from unexpected angles (“Cristiano Ronaldo vs. Lionel Messi”). Messi’s playstyle has some similarities in the athleticism part, as he has a good pace and dribbling. However, he has a lower center of gravity and uses it to bypass and outmaneuver opponents. Unlike Ronaldo, he is a predominantly left-foot player with a more complex playing style involving around engaging with the rest of the team (“Cristiano Ronaldo vs. Lionel Messi”). Based on the playstyle alone, it is impossible to determine a better player. In the scope of his career, the results between Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have been close to comparable. As of the end of 2020, Ronaldo managed to score 790 goals."
Pablo Picasso,person,1,"Pablo Picasso was inspired in his approach by the works of French impressionist painter Paul Cezanne and the pointillist painter Georges Seurat. Other influences include the intellectual works of the Fauves and African primitive art. Within his work, Picasso continued to focus on the picture plane by breaking up images into fractals. His works were characteristic of the modern abstractionists in that they focused on presenting graphic representations of emotions while freeing himself from the true representation of objects. In his paintings “Figures on Beach” (1931), for example, each figure is presented by Picasso as an abstract collection of geometric shapes. These shapes are arranged to suggest the specific emotions and feelings his figures are experiencing as they participate in their activity. His use of color is intended to convey the emotions of the moment just as the relative nature of the lines establishes the relative strength of the feelings. Picasso also strives to portray motion or action in his art by depicting more than one viewpoint at a time on the same picture plane. In “Figures on Beach"", the idea of movement is depicted through Picasso’s placement of the eyes and nostrils of the figures in various places, as if their faces are moving all around. Picasso also seems to have placed the woman’s breasts in random places to make them more accessible and interesting. There is a confusion of body parts in which the arms and legs become almost interchangeable."
Elon Musk,person,1,"Elon Reeves Musk is the company CEO of Tesla, a producer of electric vehicles. Besides the top CEO role, he is the company’s product architect, which he joined in 2004 before later becoming the CEO in 2008. He invested over 6 million US Dollars in the company, which propelled him to join Tesla’s board of directors serving as its chairman. His management style revolves around consistent learning, breakthrough, and innovation (Musk, 2021). For instance, he has invested the company’s shares in bitcoin digital currency, translating from 1.5 billion US Dollars to over 2.4 billion US Dollars. During Musk’s tenure, Tesla has had more than one billion US Dollars net income, from about 12 billion US Dollars in revenue (Yahoo Finance). Musk has undoubtedly boosted the robust development of Tesla through his technical work and leadership. Elon Musk is a transformational leader focused on bettering the business world through technology. Musk is an atypical entrepreneur whose leadership focus and style are peculiar to the vehicle industry. He has a personal conviction to push his agenda forward, which can be seen from his financing of the SpaceX project. His leadership, though transformational, faces several criticisms due to his unconventional means of running his company operations. Tesla employees find Musk’s way of working unbearable since it is result-oriented rather than people-focused; they hardly walk past his desk because of his hot temper and intolerance."
Martin Luther King Jr,person,1,"Many have heard of Martin Luther King Jr., who fought for the rights of black citizens in the United States, but few people know how his life developed and what contribution to history was made by a Baptist preacher. Monuments have been erected in honor of the civil rights activist, streets named, and songs were written. And, perhaps, if not for the tragic murder, Martin would have changed the life and stream of thought of even more people. The below research aims to show that Martin Luther King had a significant impact on society, providing evidence from his development as an equality activist, his activities and achievements, and the way Martin’s life was ended. Martin Luther King was born on December 15, 1929, in Atlanta to a Baptist pastor. The future wrestler took exams as an external student, and at the age of 15, he won a public speaking competition. At one time, Martin doubted which profession to give preference to – medicine or law, everything was decided in favor of the ministry of the church, which influenced the education and literacy of the future leader. In 1955 he graduated from Boston University and received a doctorate in theology. In 1953, King married Coretta Scott. The couple became known as some of the first African American Baptist leaders. After the death of her husband, Coretta continued his work. They had four children who also became social activists and fighters for human rights (Carson). "
King Henry VIII,person,1,"Henry VIII (1491-1547) was one of the prominent kings of England, and a representative of the Tudor dynasty. He ruled from 1509 until his death in 1547, but during a number of the early years of his reign, his regent, for all practical purposes, ruled the country. Henry VIII is known as the king who played a significant role in the separation of the Church of England from the Roman Catholic Church, and who established the supremacy of the English monarch over the English Church, therefore beginning the process of English Reformation. The fact that this king had six wives is widely known, as well. He also was responsible for creating a permanent English navy, which in the future became a major source of England’s power. However, the rule of Henry VIII is also known as one that bears the stains of tyranny, cruelty, mass executions of his actual and imagined opponents and so on. This paper provides an attempt to answer the question about whether Henry VIII was an effective leader. This endeavour is based on the political and social decisions made by Henry VIII during the period of his reign. In order to do this, some of the most important of these decisions are discussed with an eye to providing a factual basis for the discussion pertaining to the effectiveness of his leadership. Finally, his leadership is discussed; several different readings of the term ‘leadership’ are provided and it is assessed how effective a ‘leader’, in the given meaning, Henry VIII was."
Aristotle,person,1,"Aristotle made a discovery fundamental to all logic by introducing variables. Thus, it was shown that logic is not just a specific doctrine of specific things or terms, but the science of the laws of syllogisms, such as modus ponens or modus tollens, expressed in variables. Studying various judgments, formal logic abstracts from their specific content, revealing a structure common to objects of different content. Syllogism is the discovery of Aristotle and is the main and most original part of his logic. In the theory of syllogisms, Aristotle defined syllogism and distinguished its types, defined working and non-working types of syllogisms, and established three figures of syllogism. I find it particularly interesting that Aristotle was the first to make reasoning methods the subject of scientific research. He introduced the methods of reasoning as integral formations and not just certain reasoning components. Everything that was done in logic before Aristotle just attempted to understand individual methods and principles without any systematization and unification into a single coherent system. Thus, such concepts as Modus ponens and Modus tollens laid the foundation for understanding the definition of the truth of thinking. Thus, I am amazed at how accurately Aristotle introduced the concepts of conclusions that approach science by the rules of inference, the laws of contradiction, and the exclusion of the third."
Abraham Lincoln,person,1,"The Emancipation Proclamation brought about by the Civil War led to important milestones in ending slavery in the US. Abraham Lincoln’s ideology and effort were to ensure everyone operated within the constitutional boundaries. At the beginning of his administration, radicals pressured him to issue an Emancipation Proclamation (Cramer, 2019, p. 232). Lincoln hated slavery and felt confined through the constitutional authority since he was the president. He also felt that it would bring ideological friction to those surrounding the border who stated that legalized slavery. Therefore, Lincoln started by summoning the Border States by saying that he hoped to have Kentucky accept his plans about emancipation (Cramer, 2019, p. 233). When Lincoln began his term in office, he was not committed to eradicating slavery but halfway leading in 1863. He decided to transform from the extension of slavery to the eradication of the Peculiar Institution. In 1862, Lincoln convinced Congress to ensure there was financial support to the Union slave states (Kentucky, Delaware, Maryland, and Missouri). Financial support would be availed to the four-state if they embraced gradual emancipation. Equally, Congress abolished slavery in Columbia through the compensation scheme. The modest anti-slavery gestures became famous during the 1862 era. Lincoln further ensured that his cabinet was informed about his ideologies on freeing slaves."
Rasputin,person,1,"Rasputin had a significant impact on the royal family as well as Russia during the reign of Czar Nicholas II. Rasputin was a staret that worked his way into the royal family. The influence of Rasputin on Alexis, the heir to the throne, gave him great power. The power given to Rasputin had a notable impact among the Russian people as well as Russia. Grigory Efimovich, better known as Rasputin, was born in the town of Pokrovskoe in 1871. The name Rasputin means ""dissolute,"" for his tireless pursuit of girls, and ""crossroads,"" in which his town was located between. He had a dual reputation of ""second sight"" from the beginning. It was said that he could spot a horse thief in a crowd with one glance and predict the weather for Alexis was born with a rare disease called hemophilia. This meant that when Alexis began to bleed he would bleed uncontrollably and it could not be stopped. Rasputin treated Alexis as if he were his nanny, reading him stories, curing his headaches, but most importantly, controlling his bleeding. It was said that all that Rasputin had to do was merely tell him that it will stop and somehow, without any explanation for the occurrence, the bleeding would stop. However Rasputin managed to stop Alexis' suffering, the truth of the matter was that he gained Nicholas and Alexandra's undivided support and it gave him immense power. Czar Nicholas listened to his wife so Rasputin began to tell Alexandra what is to happen in the country. "
cancer,diseases,1,"Lung cancer is a deadly disease that endangers the lives of multiple people. Approximately 541,000 Americans living today have been diagnosed with lung cancer at some point, which is an enormous amount. However, the precise details are rarely known to other persons than the ill and their relatives. Thus, this paper aims to define what lung cancer is, what is the history behind it, and how it can affect people. The most crucial point to understand about this cancer is that it develops in the lungs and spreads throughout the body. In simple terms, when cells in the body begin to grow out of control, cancer matures and can spread to other organs. As for the history of the disease, it is known that lung cancer was discovered in the mid-19th century, although there is no information about the doctor who described it first. The other disturbing fact about lung cancer is that it is still not evident to this day the primary factors leading to the illness. However, evidence suggests that lung cancer frequently occurs among smoking people before the age of 65, so it might be possible to prevent it. The other significant information about lung cancer concerns its effect on the body and the daily lives of diseased people. In fact, human bodies are slowly being chipped away when cancer spreads and impacts the whole organism, including the brain, tissues, and muscles. Once a person gets lung cancer, it may slowly progress into cancerous cells."
ebola,diseases,1,"The emergence of new infectious diseases such as the Ebola virus has always put pressure on the health care systems resulting in high fatality rates. This disease is contagious and whose transmission depends on the interaction between the human host and an agent (CDC, 2021). This virus is classified in the filioviridae family and is responsible for destroying the blood clotting cells and weakening the immune system when someone is infected. Ebola was a contagious epidemic that affected many nations, including the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Sierra Leone, Gabon, and Italy (CDC, 2021). Therefore, Ebola’s pathophysiology, its negative impact on the community and remediation are elaborated. Ebola is a deadly disease that exhibits symptoms such as fever, body aches, diarrhea, external and internal bleeding. The infection is transmissible through direct contact with body fluids such as saliva, sweat, and blood. The virus was traced in the Ebola River in DRC after natives consumed the African fruit bat, which was identified as a reservoir for the virus (CDC, 2021). Considering the fact that the disease is contagious, it spread rapidly to other nations in that year, such as England and later on to Cote D’Ivoire, Senegal, Mali and Nigeria. This data indicates that this outbreak was a global pandemic that put pressure on the health system. Various epidemiological and risk factors contributed to the spread of this virus. "
tuberculosis,diseases,1,"The discussion post reviews tuberculosis (TB) among aging people and how statistical analysis can help with the alleviation of this problem, as one of the primary reasons is the delay in seeking medical help. The value of the universal application is also a vital takeaway from my classmate’s research. I would like to focus my response on shifts in the U.S. population and how they reinforce this issue, making TB more challenging to eliminate. Epidemiology studies can reveal additional data regarding access to healthcare and its relation to TB. The number of TB patients is in decline, although there are shifts in populations that are the most affected by it (Armstrong et al., 2019). In 2019, 70.9% of all TB cases occurred among immigrants, while U.S.-born individuals appear to be less likely to be infected (Schwartz et al., 2020). Moreover, the transmission of TB is the reason for 14.3% of all cases, making it one of the leading causes that need additional attention (Armstrong et al., 2019). I would like to ask, how do the current measures need to be adjusted to include indirect support of the older population? In conclusion, public health specialists can prevent TB with greater success by focusing on populations that are more vulnerable to it and tend to spread this disease to older adults. Despite the decrease in TB cases, the number of older adults affected by it remains stable throughout the years."
hypertension,diseases,1,"Maternal hypertension poses a high risk of morbidity and mortality for women as well as newborn babies. Careful measurement of key indicators of maternal hypertension by nurses helps to alleviate the drastic outcomes the disease may result in. Early prevention tools such as blood pressure self-monitoring in pregnancy and the adoption of a new blood pressure cut-off for the hypertensive disorders can significantly reduce the morbidity and mortality rates (Sisti & Williams, 2019). The application of these tools in nursing practice will lead to significant reduction of risks for pregnant women. The onset of maternal hypertension is characterized by the change in markers such as placental growth factor, plasma protein, and mean arterial blood pressure that nurses are trained to measure and record. The drastic change in the results analysis may point to nurses the beginning of material hypertension. Nurses should adopt new cut-off standards and advise self-monitoring to pregnant women to reduce the risks of material hypertension onset. Moreover, markers should be carefully measured to offset the possibility of the decease development. Nurses improve the maternal hypertension outcomes by adhering to new standards of disease recognition and adopting preventive measures necessary to offset the start of the decease (Hinton et al., 2017). Nurses assess the risks of maternal hypertension development by measuring health indicators that allow to judge the progress of the disease."
heart disease,diseases,1,"Coronary heart disease is a widely diagnosed physiological impairment that adversely impacts human well-being, healthy functioning and often leads to increased mortality. One of the historical figures who suffered from coronary heart disease was President William Howard Taft, who died because of heart issues on March, 8, 1930 in Washington, DC. Taft was the 27th President of the United States from 1909 till 1913; his Presidential office was followed by his appointment as a Chief Justice in the Supreme Court in 1930, soon after which he died (Fallon, 2019). This disease is particularly dependent on lifestyle choices, especially unhealthy diet, substance use, and limited movement (Severino et al., 2020). The illness is a prevailing heart problem that requires adequate prevention and treatment methods advancement. The healthy functioning of the heart is based on the non-disrupted work of the organ when pumping blood to all body systems. Under normal circumstances in a healthy individual, the blood is transmitted to the heart through coronary arteries, which provide nutrients and oxygen to body organs (Severino et al., 2020). In a healthy individual, the coronary arteries are clear without any formations that would obstruct the flow of blood to the heart. In such a manner, the delivery of blood with oxygen and nutrients to the whole body is timely and undisrupted, which guarantees the healthy functioning of the whole physiological system."
Alzheimer's,diseases,1,"Alzheimer’s disease is the most common type of dementia, and it is a condition in which the brain stops appropriately performing its functions. The first time that the disease was described was in 1907. This was by a German psychiatrist and neurologist, Alois Alzheimer, hence the name Alzheimer’s disease. Dementia is a clinical syndrome characterized by a progressive decline in two or more cognitive domains, including memory, language, executive and visuospatial function, personality, and behavior. Alzheimer’s impairs the ability to perform daily tasks. Pre-dementia is the initial stage of Alzheimer’s disease, characterized by symptoms like difficulty in remembering names, losing objects. Early dementia is associated with short-term memory becoming visible. At the same time, a person perfectly remembers events from his youth, any learned facts, applies old skills. Many patients also develop apraxia, agnosia, and speech disorder. Moderate dementia manifests itself in the loss of the ability to independent living. As a result, a person ceases to perform daily tasks: eating, hygiene procedures, and changing clothes. Memory disorders continue to progress; the patient does not remember and does not recognize even close people. At this stage, the patient becomes psycho-related. Severe dementia is the last stage of the disease and turns a person into a helpless invalid. It is characterized by incoherent speech, extreme apathy, and loss of control over physical processes."
diabetes,diseases,1,"Diabetes is a disease that occurs when the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to regulate blood sugar. Diabetes is a global health concern, and according to the World Health Organization, in 2019, it directly contributed to 1.5 million deaths (World Health Organization, 2021). Diabetes can significantly impact the heart, kidneys, and blood vessels leading to other chronic problems. In the US, diabetes is costly to treat and has caused much physical, emotional and mental harm to the people and the families of those who have been affected by the disease. Diabetes is a very prevalent health problem in the US. According to the Center For Disease Control (CDC), one in every ten people in the US has diabetes (CDC, 2022). On average, around 37 million people in the US have diabetes, and in 2019 alone, there were 1.4 million new cases of diabetes (CDC, 2022). Additionally, 96 million adult Americans have prediabetes, and eight out of every ten people do not know (World Health Organization, 2021). In 2020, it was reported that 48% of the population 65 years and above has diabetes (World Health Organization, 2021). On 2022 March 28, a tweet by CNN stated that experts had found an unraveling connection between COVID-19 and diabetes. According to the tweet, a COVID-19 infection can lead to a higher risk for diabetes (CNN, 2022). This information will likely affect how people with prediabetes protect themselves against COVID-19."
Schizophrenia,diseases,1,"Manifestations of schizophrenia radically change the habitual life of patients that they had before the manifestation of the disease. There are several reasons for these changes, and there may be different consequences. The development of schizophrenia is due to certain disorders in the cerebral cortex, as a result of which patients with schizophrenia lose specific cognitive skills, their ability to focus on productive activities weakens, and their intellectual potential and communication skills atrophy. This means that people with schizophrenia lose their former life orientations. However, life with schizophrenia can still be intense and exciting. Lieberman et al. affirm that schizophrenia does not exclude professional success, wealth in friendship and love, outdoor activities, advanced training, and other aspects of ordinary human life. The main difference between the former and new guidelines in patients’ professional and personal life will only be that people with schizophrenia will have to consider the symptoms of their illness and maintain a distance between themself as a person and the manifestations of schizophrenia. Lieberman et al. note that it is not necessary to create an artificial atmosphere around patients with schizophrenia, isolating them from living in the real world or reducing the level of their claims. Thus, despite some limitations, living with schizophrenia is not unbearable. Living with a terminal illness is a challenge in itself. "
HIV,diseases,1,"The epidemic of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has been holding a status of an epidemic since its early cases’ discovery in the 1980s. Currently, the state of Florida is a leader in the new HIV cases nationwide, constituting 4,584 new diagnoses in 2019 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2021b). Although the virus does not discriminate the population and may affect anyone, the most vulnerable populations concern sexual and ethnic minorities, as most HIV cases are found in the Black community (57,8%) and men having sexual intercourse with men (MSM, 75%) (Florida Department of Health, 2019). Given that the number of new infections continues to decrease, the progress is insignificant compared to other states and their preventive practices. Despite the existing programs to promote HIV/AIDS prevention among the population and criminalization of the failure to disclose HIV status prior to sexual intercourse, the Florida state legislature does not obtain any mandatory outreach and education programs for the population. Additionally, the focus has not been placed on the mandatory state outreach programs for the minority groups in question, as the access to HIV testing is dependent directly on the regularity of the patients’ medical check-ups. In case the issue continues, the new case rates will increase, deteriorating the magnitude of the pandemic. "
allergies,diseases,1,"Amoxicillin is a standard antibiotic often used in primary care settings. It consists of an aminopenicillin, with an extra amino group added to the penicillin, which fights antibiotic resistance (Akhavan et. al., 2020). It may cause difficulties in patients with hypersensitive reactions. The types of reactions determine the severity of the symptoms. Type-I and type-IV are the most important to remember as one can be more dangerous than the other. A type-I reaction activates a histamine release which in turn causes a pruritic rash in mild cases and systemic issues, such as anaphylaxis, in serious circumstances. While in general it is recommended that skin testing be done prior to drug provocation test in the evaluation of amoxicillin allergy, there is increasing evidence that drug provocation testing could be done in lower risk children without skin testing prior. It is estimated that while 10% or children have an amoxicillin allergy, most patients are able to tolerate the antibiotic after being evaluated (Abrams & Moshe, 2019). Testing remains necessary as allergic reactions to amoxicillin often suggest negative effects on health, but the methods remain debatable. There have been multiple studies that suggest that lower-risk patients can take drug provocation tests without prior skin testing. In a study, pediatric patients with histories of allergic reactions to amoxicillin were tested with the antibiotic. "
the effect of climate change on ecosystems,climate/animals,1,"Hill and Wilson suggest that the key to finding morally defensible solutions to address climate change is to develop appropriate dispositions that guide morality. Thus, they championed the virtues of truthfulness, justice, and hope as the ultimate solutions to climate change (Williston 249). However, these virtues demonstrate both anthropocentric and ecocentric attributes because they assign the role of environmental conservation to human beings. For example, the concepts of truthfulness, justice, and hope, still allow human beings to take advantage of their environment while believing they are not doing harm. On the other hand, ecocentric views obligate human beings to acknowledge their responsibility to nature by placing serious concern on environmental issues, which facilitate less destruction. Economic approaches to climate change spearhead policies to manage climate change by addressing the human impact in its deterioration and limiting greenhouse gas emissions, or actions that pose a threat to the future of human beings. However, these approaches are anthropocentric because they intend to alleviate the level of human destruction to the environment, but place human beings and their economic development at the center of all initiatives (Schönfield 296). Although scientists and policy-makers are aware that the climate change issues persist because of individuals’ and industries’ contributions, they neglect these issues in the name of development."
the consequences of deforestation around the world,climate/animals,1,"Deforestation has been one of the most significant threats to sustainability in the contemporary world. This process implies the excessive use of forests, including the lands and the wood material, for agriculture, fuel generation, and others. Indeed, forests are being cut into too large clear areas for fields to grow agricultural products to feed animals. Moreover, the demand for wood as a material has increased, which has yielded the intensification of deforestation. This tendency is now sustainability and environmental issue since deforestation particularly contributes to increasing greenhouse gas emissions (Miyamoto 1). Therefore, it is imperative to identify the most effective ways of reducing deforestation on a global scale to ensure environmental safety and sustainable economic development from a long-term perspective. The most effective way of solving the problem and preventing deforestation is through large-scale actions that would necessitate industries to comply with standards for deforestation minimization. According to Castro-Nunez et al., agriculture is the industry that causes the most harm to forests (5). Therefore, the first strategy that is likely to produce positive outcomes in terms of deforestation prevention is the intensification of standards and requirements for agricultural corporations. In particular, there are two ways to implement this strategy, namely through initiatives like zero-deforestation value chain interventions."
rising sea levels,climate/animals,1,"The sea level is rising faster than predicted. Melting glaciers can lead to catastrophic consequences; some regions of the world are at risk of flooding. In modern realities, the rate of warming of the World’s Oceans has increased. The active emission of carbon dioxide facilitates it into the atmosphere. If emissions are not reduced, the ocean will become more acidic and less habitable. In addition, the ocean is threatened by the processes occurring in the cryosphere. Global warming provokes the melting of ice in Greenland and Antarctica. Some cities could be underwater by 2050, according to the latest UN report on the state of the oceans, polar regions, and ice sheets. Los Angeles, Bangkok, New York, Barcelona, and Miami are among them. Jeff Goodell also noted in his book that post-hurricane Miami in 2037 will become a popular destination for diving adventures (Goodell, 2018). Goodell gives examples of trying to prevent disasters and fight against the elements, highlighting that the most technologically amazing solutions are not always the best. Large and costly engineering projects are often controversial and can result in cost overruns. Solutions such as an almost fully built floating barrier or levee or sea walls can protect cities, but there is no guarantee, considering that they are located less than six feet above the tide. Goodell, however, acknowledges that sea levels have fluctuated throughout human and geological history."
the possibility of renewable energy sources,climate/animals,1,"The climate change and environmental catastrophes it brings upon global society have been at the forefront of multiple scientific fields for the last several decades. Careless use of natural resources, fuel-linked contamination, and irresponsible waste management by businesses has led to grave environmental consequences. It is now generally accepted that a business can and should wield its financial power and resources to benefit the existing community with it exists in cooperation. This perception leads to the rise in responsible consumption, with customers paying increased attention to a firm’s environmental policies and sustainability status. Consecutively, it is now both in the societal and financial interests of corporations to invest in sustainable resource applications and environment-oriented programs. The following paper addresses some of these international policies as applied by firms and governments, particularly in relation to renewable energy sources. The first section is dedicated to discussing the main outcomes and challenges of the Climate Change Conference of the Parties 2021. The second focuses on examining two life cycle assessments and potential fracking activities-related recommendations for Texas and the UK. The third section is centered on discussing the energy efficiency measures in housing and transport areas, specifically for Sweden, the UK, and China. "
the impact of captivity on animals,climate/animals,1,"Countless individuals have fond memories of zoo or aquarium visits, circus shows, and other entertainment outlets involving captive animals; however, the enjoyment of these outlets dissipates rapidly once one looks further behind the scenes of these organizations. Places like SeaWorld, Ringling Brother’s Circus, and countless zoos across America are notorious for their mistreatment of animals. Throughout the last several decades, “organized amusement zones” have become a pivotal source of recreation and leisure worldwide. When the first SeaWorld opened in San Diego back in 1959, it rapidly became etched into the city’s landscape, and its popularity escalated the chain construction of replica parks across America. The undeviating demand of these parks intended for entertainment often surpass the harmful effects such locations can create on their inhabitant organisms (Hogan 772). Hardly any zoos register their animals on an international species database and the majority of animals located within zoos are not part of an endangered species at all. Zoos can be more accurately depicted as collections of intriguing species rather than actual havens or homes for them. Even while situated in the best circumstances, no zoo can truly replicate wild habitats. Animals who are captive bred in zoos or otherwise typically cannot function properly or in the wild as they have not gained the experience of their wild counterparts (""Zoos: Pitiful Prisons""). "
the intelligence of chimpanzees,climate/animals,1,"The article’s main argument is that animals have a culture, but inadequate evidence supports cultural traits in chimpanzees. According to the authors, other animals such as fish and birds demonstrate more skills of possessing a culture than chimpanzees. The authors argue that despite having behavioral characteristics, chimpanzees do not exhibit social learning hence lack aspects that make up a culture. In this article, the authors argue that apes have culture through their inventions rather than mimicking human culture. The authors use experimental evidence, which involves three groups of chimpanzees performing different tasks. According to the researchers, the experiments show that different chimpanzee communities observe specific traditions in situations similar to human beings. This article’s central argument states that chimpanzees have diverse cultures which pass from generation to generation, just like human beings. The report provides evidence which confirms that chimpanzees do not mimic humans or re-invent cultures to enhance their knowledge but follow the existing etiquette. The authors claim insufficient research on the diversity of chimpanzees’ culture compared to human cultures and suggest further research to determine the variability in chimpanzee cultures. Various anthropological studies indicate that human beings and apes are close relatives genetically. The closest apes to humans are the chimpanzees, who exhibit almost similar DNA and physical make-up. "
the dangers of parasites,climate/animals,1,"Most parasites become less toxic to their hosts over evolutionary time. According to the scientific research conducted on parasites today, an evolutionary examination concludes that the parasites would virtually be harmless to the principal host organism. This research has been backed up by the scientific notion that it is because the host serves as the environment where the parasite generally survives and sexually copulates (Price, 1980). Consequently, when the parasite causes any toxic harm to its host organism, it would be counterproductive to its survival as well. As a result, the characteristics of the parasite that is relatively harmless to the prime host, for example as found in cats, would be anticipated to evolve. This is because the parasites that behave in that manner would have a better rate of reproduction. On the other hand, the parasite would equally be anticipated to be rather harmful to the secondary host organism. This is explained by the fact that the parasite will never get to the main host unless the secondary host is consumed by the main host. Subsequently, within the secondary host, the behavior of the parasite that makes the secondary host more at vulnerable risk to being consumed by the primary host would be anticipated to evolve. The parasites that act as a result of that would therefore have a better opportunity of getting to the main host and hence reproducing into it. "
new farming techniques,climate/animals,1,"Organic food crops differ in terms of nutritional value from food crops grown through conventional farming methods (fertilizer-based). Studies have found differences in micronutrient levels, including minerals and vitamins, between fruits/vegetables grown organically and those cultivated using conventional farming methods. Bourn and Prescott (2002) found that organically grown strawberries, apples, and potatoes, among others, have less nitrogen content, high mineral content (calcium, sodium, and iron), and high levels of vitamin C. In contrast, food crops grown through conventional farming, which involves the use of fertilizers (nitrates) and pesticides, have relatively high nitrate and pesticide levels (Lima & Vianello 2011). Thus, the type of fertilizer used can cause variation in nutrient content between these food types. Organic farming relies on manure-based fertilization, while conventional farming uses synthetic nitrate fertilizers. Stracke, Rufer, Weibel, Bub, and Watzl (2009) report that manure-based fertilization results in improved vitamin A, C, and B12 compared to nitrate-based fertilization of various crops grown under similar climatic conditions. The difference in fertilization between the two methods causes variations in nutrient content. Another study by Raigon, Rodriguez-Burruezo, and Prohens (2010) found a variation in the level of phytochemicals in food crops grown using the two farming methods."
the impact of natural disasters,climate/animals,1,"Disasters are some disturbances that lead to problems in the functioning of the community. They might be natural or human-made, depending on the nature of the disaster, but they all are harmful. A hurricane, also known as a tropical cyclone, is a type of storm that occurs over tropical or subtropical oceans and will be covered in this essay. Hurricanes are dangerous and pose numerous environmental concerns, including the destruction of infrastructure and natural resources and a severe impact on a population’s mental health. The level of storm preparedness should be increased to find a solution to the problem. Hurricanes have a negative impact on infrastructure, the environment, and human health. Damage to infrastructure is frequently a result of natural disasters. Although the conventional electric power-producing infrastructure was only a little damaged, the transmission and distribution elements of the grid were severely damaged (Kwasinski et al., 2019). Hurricanes may harm natural things and landscapes, such as forests and infrastructure. Topography influences forest change and structure loss from tropical cyclones at the landscape scale. Wind speed and forest structural damage have been discovered to have substantial connections at the regional scale. On September 20, 2017, Storm Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico as a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale, wreaking havoc on the island’s forests (Feng et al., 2020). "
the dangers of invasive species,climate/animals,1,"Exotic organisms cause a great harm to the existing a balanced ecosystem in forests and grasslands. Their devastating effects on ecology have led to long periods of research. However, there has been insufficient research on the impact of invasive plants on ecological associations in native communities (Klopfer, 2009). Their effects on a new environment is that they may perform better in the new conditions and may interfere chemically with the performance of existing native plants (Stinson et al, 2006). When exotic and native species invade an area, their existence will be determined by the mutual associations of native birds, insects with soil microbes by symbiosis. Biological invasions are commonly caused by global changes in the environment that are the result of human pollution activities (Vitousek et al, 1997). Such invasive species can have detrimental effects on the health of humans, alter stabilized ecosystems, and threaten the biological diversity of native lands. Therefore researchers are working towards changing the approach of humans towards the global environment (Tye, 2009). The following are talks by scientists and researchers on invasive species and exotic organisms, and their detrimental effects on the environment. The Longhorned beetle first originated in China with other appearances in Korea, New York and Chicago. Their origin in China dates back to 50 years ago."
Stonehenge,landmarks,1,"Stonehenge ranks among the English prehistoric monuments situated in Wiltshire County, to the North of Salisbury. It consists of earthworks, which form a perimeter around large vertically positioned stones, making it one of the most illustrious old-fashioned locations globally. The exact time they came about is unknown; although, several proposals have been fronted by scholars. It is noteworthy that the ownership of this monument is reserved for the crown. This places it under the supervision of the English heritage. The contiguous land is possessed and managed by the National Trust. Despite enormous efforts, being plowed into studies on the same, little has been discovered concerning the actual age, placing it among the mysteries of the world. Studies reveal that the original sculpt featured a rounded ravine having a band of 56 holes in the region of its boundary. This was done by the semi-nomadic tribes that inhabited the plains of Salisbury. Several stones used in this construction were sourced from the Welsh coast and ferried upstream on rafts. It is believed that this was still a work in progress, given that the arrangement of the stones was altered to create space for new ones. Summarily, experts assume that they were constructed in the course of the Neolithic era, which dates back to the application of bronze technology. The foremost phase is believed to be a work of the native Neolithic populace, who dug out circular trenches using crude materials. "
The Washington Monument,landmarks,1,"The most stunning monument in our capital is the Washington Monument. At 555 feet high, it is the tallest such monument in the world. It is an obelisk by shape, yet not a true obelisk because it is not carved out of a single stone. The monument was built at intervals between 1848 and 1885. It memorializes George Washington's achievements and his devotion to principles and to his country. The Washington Monument has an interesting history. The idea of a monument celebrating George Washington was first considered by the Continental Congress in 1783. However, the next three decades brought neglect by Congress to take action. The design of the Washington Monument is a common obelisk and can be found around the world. Its history begins in Egypt. There were a great many obelisks in Egypt, 13 were originally in Karnak where now only 5 stand. Possibly the best known obelisk in Egypt is at the Temple of Luxor in Thebe. This obelisk was raised by Ramses II. He is credited with raising over fourteen obelisks at Tanis alone. The obelisk at the Temple of Luxor was originally one of a pair of obelisks. This missing obelisk was later removed and brought to Paris where it stands in the Place de la Concorde. Many of the obelisks that were originally in Egypt are now in different parts of the world. It appears that these obelisks were the focus of conquerors of Egypt. For example, the Persian leader Cambyses dragged many of these obelisks to the ground and mutilated them. "
Machu Pichu,landmarks,1,"Such an implausible site Machu Picchu is too see with a human’s eye. This sacred place was built hundreds of years ago and is still one of the most wonderful places a tourist should visit. It incorporates beauty, spiritual feelings , and knowledge of an ancient civilization. Machu Picchu is a significant travel destination for tourists because it's scenically attractive, it is an archaeological wonder, and it represents old civilization life. The ancient wonder, Machu Picchu, should be a travel destination for tourists because of its attractive scenery. Not only does Machu Picchu serve a purpose towards beauty and wonder, but it's also a symbol of historic value. Machu Picchu must have served many purposes in survival of the Incas. Machu Picchu gives an insight to how the Incas survived in Peru. “To this day many of Machu Picchu's mysteries remain unresolved, including the exact role it may have played in the Inca’s sophisticated understanding of astronomy and domestication of wild species” (UNESCO). Machu Picchu shows us humans that the Incas knew how to use agriculture to its advantage and how they used their intelligence towards hunting and even the creation of Machu Picchu. Tourists will enhance numerous quantities of knowledge if they visit Machu Picchu. Visiting Machu Picchu would feel the same as if standing in past day Inca civilization. That is the effect Machu Picchu will have."
The Pyramids of Giza,landmarks,1,"The pyramids of Giza are masterpiece architectural setups that were constructed many years ago in Egypt. The pyramids hold immense historical and cultural significance to most individuals as they give a clear picture of ancient activities and construction styles. The architectural setups that are also known as pyramids of Khufu were constructed in a large area. One of the pyramids remains the largest and oldest compared to other pyramids within the Giza necropolis. This is evident since it covers a wide area of about 350 meters and it measures over 481 feet tall. Indeed, the great pyramid of Giza holds immense historical and cultural significance to most individuals especially in Egypt (Jarus, 2013). It is imperative to note that the pyramids of Giza remain the tallest and most glamorous man-made structures globally. They have constructed over 3800 years ago with the purpose of serving as the administrative and cultural center in Egypt. This is evident since the structures have three main chambers that are well constructed with each chamber having exclusive decorations. The main chambers include lower chambers that are located at the bedrock of the pyramids and queens and kings chambers that are located much higher within the structure (Ismail, 2002). The pyramids were built using quality materials that include casing stones that are of high value in Egypt. The stones that are still being seen around the base of the structures formed their smooth outer surfaces. "
Niagara Falls,landmarks,1,"There are many natural places all over the world. One of the places I have been to, and really enjoyed, is Niagara Falls. This place is absolutely amazing. It has amazing sights and scenes, as well as other fun tourist attractions. Going on the tour at Niagara Falls taught me a lot about the site. I love this place because everytime I go there I am sent to this place that I could find, it just takes me away I went to Niagara Falls when I was about 12. I stepped out of the car and just hearing the incredible sound of the Falls, I was taken. It was so loud, just a huge roar of all the water going over the edge. It surprised me because I didn’t think it would be that loud. It only got louder and louder as I got to the rail by the edge of the fall. Seeing the view of the falls took my breath away. Between the blue of the flowing river water, the white of the rough water falling over the side, and the mist of the water splattering off the rocks at the bottom of the waterfall, I was taken by its glory. Add on the view of the city too and it was just an amazing experience for me. When I went on the tour I was told a lot of facts that I found very interesting. For example, on the American side it is 1060 feet long and 176 feet tall. It would be about 70 feet, but on account of the rocks at the base it is 176 feet. Also, the American side has a volume of about 150,000 US Gallons. Being as young as I was, I was super impressed with these numbers. "
Mount Rushmore,landmarks,1," Rushmore memorializes the birth, growth, preservation and development of the USA. Between 1927 and 1941, Gutzon Borglum and 400 workers sculpted the 60-foot busts of Presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln to represent the first 150 years of American history. Visitors to the memorial come primarily to view the granite sculpture itself, but also of interest is the Sculptor's Studio built under the direction of the artist, Gutzon Borglum, in 1939. Unique plaster models and tools related to the sculpting process are displayed there. Recently, ten years of redevelopment word culminated with the completion of extensive new visitor facilities. These include a new Visitor Center and Museum and the Presidential Trail, a walking trail and boardwalk providing spectacular close-up views of the mountain sculpture. The memorial serves as home to many animals and plants representative of the Black Hills of South Dakota. The geologic formations of the heart of the Black Hills region are also evident at Mount Rushmore, including large outcrops of granite and mica schist. At this moment I will inform you about the history, creation, and the location and setup of Mt. Rushmore. It all started as an idea to draw sightseers. In 1923 state historian Doane Robinson suggested carving some giant statues in South Dakota's Black Hills. First of all, He based the models on life masks, paintings, descriptions, and his own interpretation. "
Taj Mahal,landmarks,1,"Architecture, symbolism, and urban significance an architectural historian Ebba Koch claims that the Taj Mahal, built in 1632, in Agra, under the patronage of Shah Jahan, was not just a burial place for Shah’s wife, but a powerful tool to emphasize the significance of the ruler, and support the dominant imperial ideology, a framework that presupposed the mighty monarch and justification of the imperial society as the only way to evolve. Based on the analysis of palaces built under Shah’s patronage, Koch supposes that one of the essential goals of the Taj Mahal was to demonstrate Shah Jahan’s significance for the country and create a visible and impressive monument to his exceptional power and rule. For this reason, the building combines many unique solutions and features, differentiating it from other ones, and forming a recognizable image of the mausoleum. To prove the idea that architecture, symbolism and urban significance of the mausoleum praise Shah, he focuses on the in-depth analysis of the building, its style, selection of the place, and purpose. The Taj Mahal is known as a burial place for the wife of a ruler, Mumtaz Mahal. At the same time, Koch champions the idea that grief was not the only reason for this project. He points out that the surrounding, the peculiarities of the area, and the role architecture played at that period of time preconditioned the use of this art as the tool to popularize the name of Shah Jahan and make his rule memorable."
Palace of Versailles,landmarks,1,"The Palace of Versailles, built just a few miles outside the capital of Paris is a true example of royalty and a seamless, flawless piece of architectural work built by a man, a king, an absolute monarch, King Louis XIV. Louis XIV was born heir and successor to Louis XIII and took throne after his father’s untimely death. As Louis XIV took control, his 72-year long reign of absolute monarchy began and ended only when his eyes shut (longest rule amongst any monarchs at his time), making him “history’s best example of an absolute monarch” (Ramírez, “Absolute Monarchy and France”). He was also known as the “Sun God” (Ramírez, “Absolute Monarchy and France”) because he believed the entire universe revolved around him. To consolidate his rule in absolutism, he built the Palace from a mere royal hunting lodge, to one of history’s greatest Palaces. The building of the Palace led to centralization of power in France, rapid spreading of French culture and etiquettes across Europe, and is a building of great importance even today. Although the Palace is centuries old, even in present day, it is used for important national occasions, high-level meetings, and as a beautiful tourist landmark. It is a notable fact that even today, the Prime Minister of France visits the Palace on the Republic day as an action of respect to the French history. Moreover, important government meetings involving head of states, are held at the Palace all year around."
Parthenon,landmarks,1,"The Parthenon is one of the iconic ancient Greek temples. It is considered the embodiment of beauty and the classical Greek style. It was built in the 5th century B.C.E., which is taken as the high classical moment for the whole Western civilization (“Parthenon (Acropolis)”). The construction is dedicated to Athena, the goddess of wisdom protecting Athens. The temple has recognizable and iconic features familiarizing viewers with the peculiarities of the Greek style. The Doric elements, such as massive columns, shallow broad flutes, vertical lines, and columns touching the stylobate (“Parthenon (Acropolis).”). These features contribute to the creation of a classic, and at the same time, beautiful image that can be easily recognized even today The importance of this concept of beauty is evidenced by the fact that many buildings today, such as Le Madeleine in Paris or Jefferson Memorial are built following the style (“Parthenon (Acropolis).”). This understanding of beauty in Architecture became critically important for the next generations. Another notable feature of the Parthenon is the existence of sculptures to emphasize the beauty of the place and show its importance. For instance, the west pediment is decorated with sculptures depicting Athena battling with Poseidon to explain who was the real patron of the ancient city (Ryals 159). Sculptures are another critical part of ancient Greek culture, and they also embodied their vision of beauty. "
The Colosseum,landmarks,1,"Art of different periods shows the development of people’s history. Paintings, architecture, sculpture and other types of art which managed to remain till our times give people a lot of information about times when ancient people lived, how they lived and what materials they used in order to make their life comfortable. Pieces of art, which remained till our times, show us cultural level of people, their interests and as a result the level of their mental development. Colosseum in Rome is the building which remained till our times. This building shows us the level of ancient Roman culture, the meaning of the theater during those times. It is the main monument in Rome. It was built in the Romans times by Vespasian and completed by his son Titus. It building was started in AD 72 and finished in AD 80. Colosseum has such sizes: 614 ft (187 m) long, 509 ft (115 m) wide and 187 ft (57 m) high. The building could comprise 50,000 spectators, according to modern investigations. The building was built during the ruling of two different persons, so the architectural decisions differ in some ways. It seems that Vespasian completed three first rangers and his follower, Titus, added two more rangers. Colosseum was built out of travertine blocks. One block was 5 feet high and 10 feet long (1.5 by 3 meters). These blocks were fixed together with metal cramps, thanks to which these blocks gave elliptical shape of the walls. (Langmead & Garnaut, 2001)"
