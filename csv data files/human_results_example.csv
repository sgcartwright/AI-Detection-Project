1,Starry Night,art,"The masterpiece depicts the view from the window in his asylum room with the addition of an imaginary village. Since 1941, the piece of art has been owned by the Modern Museum of Art in New York City. This picture is a perfect representation of Van Gogh’s distinctive style and creates a strange but breathtaking impression. The artwork provides an uneasy feeling as if it has been painted with the mental struggle of the author. The first element of the composition that captures attention is the great blurry sky that takes one-third of the canvas. The sky emphasizes a bright crescent moon in the top right corner, which creates a powerful balance and, at the same time, contrast with the giant black fire on the opposite side. Another contrast may be seen in the color dynamics of the whirling sky that provide the sense of surreal harmony compared to the dull mixed colors of the imaginary village. The artwork seems to be filled with uneasy emotions and even paranoia of the author. The emphasis on the big bright sky may represent Van Gogh’s desire to fly away from his reality and embrace the light of the starry night. However, the enormous dark fire, which plays the role of some dark force in his painting, rises almost to the top of the picture. It may be described as if the dark creation of reality tries to cover the beloved stars from the author and steal his attention. In this light, the masterpiece tells the story about Van Gogh’s most precious object, starry sky.",0.03,1.0,0.0,0.99
